Then the customer chooses the date and time of the show and the number of reservations they wish to make. If the number of bookings is> 1, then the ticket provided is actually a subscription. The car will display a list of free seats. The customer selects the desired place / places and the system calculates and displays the cost of the ticket / subscription.
